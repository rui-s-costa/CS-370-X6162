## Project Explanation

### Work Summary:

I was provided with the skeleton of a reinforcement learning model based on the Q-learning approach. The project's primary goal was to enable an agent to navigate a maze and find a treasure using neural networks. I was given the maze setup, the basics of maze interaction, and some Q-learning components. 

The core code I created and integrated into the given code includes:
- The model-building function that defines the neural network to approximate the Q-function.
- The Q-training function that trains the model using experiences.
- The game-playing function to test the model's performance.
- Utility functions like `format_time` for better output understanding.

### Connections to Computer Science:

#### 1. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, develop, and apply the software and hardware systems that drive our digital age. They innovate to create new technologies, solve complex problems, and explore the boundaries of what's possible. For instance, in this project, we used computer science concepts to design an intelligent agent that learns from its experiences and makes decisions to navigate a maze.

#### 2. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When approaching a problem, I:
- **Analyze and Understand**: Before jumping to a solution, I first seek to understand the problem deeply. In the maze project, it was crucial to understand the maze's dynamics and the agent's possible actions.
- **Design**: After understanding, I plan a structured approach to tackle the problem. In this context, it meant designing the Q-learning approach with a neural network.
- **Implement and Test**: I then convert the design into functional code and test it rigorously. Our play game function and Q-train function are results of this step.
- **Iterate**: Based on tests, I refine and iterate my approach to enhance performance, as seen in the continual training of our model.

#### 3. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist:
- **Privacy and Security**: I am responsible for ensuring that any data involved, especially if belonging to end-users, is protected and secure.
- **Transparency**: I should be clear about how a system works and the implications of its use. In this maze project, the training and decision processes should be transparent.
- **Avoiding Bias**: Any AI or ML system should be tested for biases and should strive for fairness in decisions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: I have a responsibility to continually enhance and optimize solutions, ensuring that they remain relevant, efficient, and beneficial to end-users and organizations.

In this project, our primary responsibility was to ensure the model learned efficiently and made optimal decisions when navigating the maze, providing a foundation for more complex decision-making systems in real-world applications.
